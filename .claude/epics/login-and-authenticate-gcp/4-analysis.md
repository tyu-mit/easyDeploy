# Issue #4 Analysis: Implement CLI Commands with Project Management

## Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: Core CLI Commands
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Scope**: Add GCP authentication and project management commands to CLI
**Files**:
- `src/easydeploy/cli/gcp.py` (extend with all 5 commands)
- `src/easydeploy/cli/main.py` (potentially add gcp subcommand group)

**Work**:
- Add gcp subcommand group with login, logout, status, list-projects, select-project commands
- Integrate with existing Click CLI framework
- Import and use authentication functions from gcp_auth.py
- Implement interactive project selection interface

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately, Issue #3 OAuth implementation completed)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Stream B: Project Management Backend
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Scope**: Add project listing and selection functionality to auth module
**Files**:
- `src/easydeploy/gcp_auth.py` (add project management functions)

**Work**:
- Implement list_projects() - fetch available GCP projects
- Implement set_project() - save current project selection
- Implement get_current_project() - retrieve current project
- Add project management to status display
- Create authentication check decorator for other GCP commands

**Dependencies**: Can start immediately, coordinates with Stream A
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

## Parallel Execution Strategy

Streams work on different files:
- Stream A: CLI commands in `gcp.py`
- Stream B: Backend functions in `gcp_auth.py`

**Parallel Approach Implemented**: Both streams can work simultaneously:
1. Stream A: CLI command structure (all 5 commands)
2. Stream B: Project management backend functions

Coordination needed for interface between CLI and auth module.

## Definition of Done Validation

All acceptance criteria must be met:
- [x] `easydeploy gcp login` command working (Stream A)
- [x] `easydeploy gcp logout` command working (Stream A)
- [x] `easydeploy gcp status` command working (Stream A)
- [x] `easydeploy gcp list-projects` command working (Stream A)
- [x] `easydeploy gcp select-project` command working (Stream A)
- [x] Project management functions implemented (Stream B)
- [x] Authentication check decorator ready (Stream B)
- [x] Clear error messages and user-friendly output (Both streams)
- [x] Manual testing successful (Both streams)
