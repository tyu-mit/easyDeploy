# Task: Implement CLI Commands

## Description
Create the GCP CLI commands for authentication and project management: login, logout, status, project selection, and project listing. Integrate with existing CLI framework and add authentication validation for future GCP commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement `easydeploy gcp login` command
  - Triggers OAuth flow from Task 002
  - Shows success message with authenticated user info
  - Handles errors gracefully with clear messages
- [x] Implement `easydeploy gcp logout` command
  - Removes stored token file
  - Shows confirmation message
- [x] Implement `easydeploy gcp status` command
  - Shows authentication status (authenticated/not authenticated)
  - Displays user email and current GCP project if authenticated
  - Shows token expiration info
- [x] Implement `easydeploy gcp select-project` command
  - Interactive project selection with numbered menu
  - Lists available projects and allows selection
  - Updates current project configuration
- [x] Implement `easydeploy gcp list-projects` command
  - Lists all available GCP projects for authenticated user
  - Shows project ID and name in readable format
- [x] Create authentication check function for other GCP commands
  - Simple function that returns True/False for authentication status
  - Clear error message format for unauthenticated state

## Technical Details
- Integrate with existing CLI framework (Click, argparse, etc.)
- Add `gcp` subcommand group if it doesn't exist
- Use authentication functions from Task 002
- Error messages should instruct users to run `easydeploy gcp login`
- Keep CLI output simple and user-friendly

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (OAuth implementation)
- [ ] Understand existing CLI framework structure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on auth implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All five commands working correctly
- [x] Commands integrated with existing CLI structure
- [x] Clear, helpful output messages
- [x] Authentication check function ready for other commands
- [x] Project management functionality fully implemented
- [x] Manual testing of all command flows successful
