# Task: Implement CLI Commands

## Description
Create the three CLI commands for GCP authentication: login, logout, and status. Integrate with existing CLI framework and add authentication validation for future GCP commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `easydeploy gcp login` command
  - Triggers OAuth flow from Task 002
  - Shows success message with authenticated user info
  - Handles errors gracefully with clear messages
- [ ] Implement `easydeploy gcp logout` command
  - Removes stored token file
  - Shows confirmation message
- [ ] Implement `easydeploy gcp status` command
  - Shows authentication status (authenticated/not authenticated)
  - Displays user email and GCP project if authenticated
  - Shows token expiration info
- [ ] Create authentication check function for other GCP commands
  - Simple function that returns True/False for authentication status
  - Clear error message format for unauthenticated state

## Technical Details
- Integrate with existing CLI framework (Click, argparse, etc.)
- Add `gcp` subcommand group if it doesn't exist
- Use authentication functions from Task 002
- Error messages should instruct users to run `easydeploy gcp login`
- Keep CLI output simple and user-friendly

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (OAuth implementation)
- [ ] Understand existing CLI framework structure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on auth implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All three commands working correctly
- [ ] Commands integrated with existing CLI structure
- [ ] Clear, helpful output messages
- [ ] Authentication check function ready for other commands
- [ ] Manual testing of all command flows successful
