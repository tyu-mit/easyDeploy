# Task: Setup Dependencies and Project Structure

## Description
Set up the basic project structure and dependencies needed for GCP authentication. This includes adding the required Python packages and creating the initial directory structure for the authentication module.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `google-auth-oauthlib` to project dependencies (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Create basic directory structure: `src/python/` if not exists
- [ ] Create empty `src/python/gcp_auth.py` file with module docstring
- [ ] Create `~/.easydeploy/` directory structure for token storage
- [ ] Verify dependencies install correctly

## Technical Details
- Add google-auth-oauthlib>=1.0.0 to dependencies
- Follow project's existing dependency management approach (requirements.txt vs pyproject.toml)
- Create basic module structure following project conventions
- Ensure directory permissions are correct for token storage

## Dependencies
- [ ] Determine existing CLI framework used in project
- [ ] Check current Python dependency management approach

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 2-4 hours
- Parallel: false (foundation for other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dependencies added and installable
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Basic module file exists
- [ ] No import errors when importing new dependencies
