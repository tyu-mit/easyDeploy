# Task: Simple Testing and Validation

## Description
Simple manual testing of the GCP authentication and project management flow to ensure it works for the internal team. Focus on practical validation rather than comprehensive testing.

## Acceptance Criteria (Simplified)
- [ ] Manual test: `uv run python -m easydeploy.cli.main gcp login`
- [ ] Manual test: `uv run python -m easydeploy.cli.main gcp status`
- [ ] Manual test: `uv run python -m easydeploy.cli.main gcp list-projects`
- [ ] Manual test: `uv run python -m easydeploy.cli.main gcp select-project`
- [ ] Manual test: `uv run python -m easydeploy.cli.main gcp logout`
- [ ] Verify token file created in `~/.easydeploy/gcp-token.json`
- [ ] Test with at least one team member's Google account
- [ ] Update README with basic usage examples

## Technical Details (Simplified)
- Manual testing only - no automated test suite needed
- Test on Linux (team's primary platform)
- Use real GCP account for authentication
- Test project selection with multiple available projects
- Document basic setup if needed

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 4 completed (CLI commands including project management)
- [ ] Team member has Google account with multiple GCP projects for testing

## Effort Estimate (Revised)
- Size: XS
- Hours: 1-2 hours
- Parallel: false (simple manual testing)

## Definition of Done (Simplified)
- [ ] All five authentication and project commands work manually
- [ ] Project selection and listing functionality verified
- [ ] README updated with usage examples
- [ ] No blocking issues for team usage
