# Issue #2 Analysis: Setup Dependencies and Project Structure

## Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: Dependencies Management
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Scope**: Add required Python dependencies
**Files**:
- `pyproject.toml` (or requirements.txt)
- Verify installation

**Work**:
- Add google-auth-oauthlib>=1.0.0 to dependencies
- Follow existing dependency management approach
- Test installation

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Stream B: Directory Structure & Module Creation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Scope**: Create project structure and basic module
**Files**:
- `src/python/` (verify/create directory)
- `src/python/gcp_auth.py` (create empty module)
- `~/.easydeploy/` (create token storage directory)

**Work**:
- Ensure src/python/ directory exists
- Create gcp_auth.py with module docstring
- Create ~/.easydeploy/ for token storage
- Set proper directory permissions

**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

## Parallel Execution Strategy

Both streams can run in parallel as they work on different files:
- Stream A: Dependencies (pyproject.toml)
- Stream B: Directory structure (src/ directories and files)

No coordination needed between streams for this task.

## Definition of Done Validation

Both streams must complete for task completion:
- [x] Dependencies added and installable (Stream A)
- [x] Directory structure created (Stream B)  
- [x] Basic module file exists (Stream B)
- [x] No import errors when importing new dependencies (Both streams)
