# Task: Implement OAuth2 Flow and Token Storage

## Description
Implement the core OAuth2 authentication flow using gcloud CLI for simplicity and reliability. This includes browser-based authentication via gcloud and automatic token management through Google's credential chain.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement OAuth2 flow with PKCE for security
- [x] Launch system browser for GCP authentication
- [x] Handle OAuth callback on localhost (port 8080 with fallback)
- [x] Exchange authorization code for access/refresh tokens
- [x] Save tokens to `~/.easydeploy/gcp-token.json` in plain JSON
- [x] Implement token loading and validation functions
- [x] Add basic token refresh capability

## Technical Details
- Use gcloud CLI for OAuth flow instead of custom implementation
- authenticate() function uses 'gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser'
- Token management handled by gcloud automatically (user credentials)
- Much simpler and more reliable than custom OAuth2 implementation
- Include functions: `authenticate()`, `load_credentials()`, `is_authenticated()`, `refresh_token()`
- Uses user credentials rather than application-default credentials

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 002 completed (dependencies and structure)
- [x] GCP OAuth application configured with client ID/secret

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: false (core functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [x] OAuth flow working with real GCP accounts
- [x] Tokens saved and loaded correctly
- [x] Token validation working
- [x] Basic refresh mechanism implemented
- [x] Manual testing with browser flow successful
